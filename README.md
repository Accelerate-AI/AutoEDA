# AutoEDA (Automated Exploratory Data Analysis)

## 1. Objective

To provide what is AutoEDA, what is the need, why it is used in Data Science projects and what are the libraries / packages that we can leverage from programming language such as Python to help facilitate data exploration and data analysis efforts in any project.

## 2. What is AutoEDA

Any Data Science project/program follows the CRISP-DM methodology. Data Understanding and Data Preparation phases involve EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and this is where we perform data exploration.

Why do we need EDA:
-	Extracting key variables and leaving behind not-so-important variables
-	Identifying various aspects such as outliers, missing values, or any human error in the dataset
-	Understanding the relationship between variables that are present or not present
-	Maximizing our insights of a dataset and minimizing potential error that may occur later in the process by ensuring understanding of data pattern better

How AutoEDA comes into play:
- We leverage some of the existing packages to **save time** in our analysis efforts
- There is need to analyze lots of messy and large datasets at initial phases in DS program for "Data Understanding". This is where AutoEDA helps **quick insight generation**
- **Feature wise comparision** of understanding data patterns and uncovering hidden insights which is a key step before we perform any "Data Preparation" / "Feature Engineering" step prior to Model development

## 3. AutoEDA Options with Features

Some of the key AutoEDA in Python are as follows:

Package / Library Name | Features                            | URL Reference         |
-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|
Pandas Profiling       | Type inference, Quantile and Descriptive Stats, Most frequent values, Histogram, Correlations, Missing Values, Text analysis, Image analysis |https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/ |
SweetViz               | Target Analysis, Visualize and Compare, Mixed-Type Associations, Type Inference, Summary Information | https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/ |
AutoViz                | Scatter Plots, Pair-wise Scatter Plots, Histograms (KDE Plots), Violin Plot, Heatmap, Bar Plots  | https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz |
LUX                    | Correlation, Distribution, Occurrence, Geographical analysis, Current visualization and comparision with Enhance/Filter/Generalize approach | https://pypi.org/project/lux-api/ |
DataPrep               | Distributions, Correlations, Missing Values analysis, Profile Report with various stats, Time series data analysis, Faster than others like Pandas Profiling due to Dask based computing module | https://pypi.org/project/dataprep/ |
D Tale                 | Combination of Flask back-end and React front-end to view and analyze Pandas data structures, Integrates with IPython notebooks, supports interactive plots, 3d plots, heat maps, the correlation between features, builds custom columns etc. | https://pypi.org/project/dtale/ |

**P.S: This may not be an exhaustive list**
