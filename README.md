# AutoEDA (Automated Exploratory Data Analysis)

## 1. Objective

To understand what is AutoEDA, what is the need, why it is used in Data Science projects and what are the libraries / packages that we can leverage from programming language perspective such as Python to help facilitate data exploration and data analysis efforts in any project.

## 2. What is AutoEDA

Any Data Science project/program follows the CRISP-DM methodology. Data Understanding and Data Preparation phases involve EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and this is where we perform data exploration. It is one of the most important phases of end to end Data Science lifecycle.

Why do we need EDA:
-	Extracting key variables and leaving behind not-so-important variables
-	Identifying various aspects such as outliers, missing values, or any human error in the dataset
-	Understanding the relationship between variables that are present or not present
-	Maximizing our insights of a dataset and minimizing potential error that may occur later in the process by ensuring understanding of data pattern better

How AutoEDA comes into play:
- We leverage some of the existing packages to **save time** in our analysis efforts
- There is need to analyze lots of messy and large datasets at initial phases in DS program for "Data Understanding". This is where AutoEDA helps **quick insight generation**
- **Feature wise comparision** of understanding data patterns and uncovering hidden insights which is a key step before we perform any "Data Preparation" / "Feature Engineering" step prior to Model development



## 3. AutoEDA Options with Features

Some of the key AutoEDA packages in Python are as follows:

Package / Library Name | Features                            | URL Reference(s)         |
-----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
Pandas Profiling       | Type inference, Quantile and Descriptive Stats, Most frequent values, Histogram, Correlations, Missing Values, Text analysis, Image analysis |<ul> <li> https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/ </li> <li> https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/ </li> |
SweetViz               | Target Analysis, Visualize and Compare, Mixed-Type Associations, Type Inference, Summary Information |<ul> <li> https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/ </li> |
AutoViz                | Scatter Plots, Pair-wise Scatter Plots, Histograms (KDE Plots), Violin Plot, Heatmap, Bar Plots  | <ul> <li> https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz </li>|
LUX                    | Correlation, Distribution, Occurrence, Geographical analysis, Current visualization and comparision with Enhance/Filter/Generalize approach | <ul> <li> https://pypi.org/project/lux-api/ </li>|
DataPrep               | Distributions, Correlations, Missing Values analysis, Profile Report with various stats, Time series data analysis, Faster than others like Pandas Profiling due to Dask based computing module |<ul> <li> https://pypi.org/project/dataprep/ </li> |
D Tale                 | Combination of Flask back-end and React front-end to view and analyze Pandas data structures, Integrates with IPython notebooks, supports interactive plots, 3d plots, heat maps, the correlation between features, builds custom columns etc. | <ul> <li> https://pypi.org/project/dtale/ </li>|

## 4. Notebooks / Kernels

Sample Notebooks are kept [here](https://github.com/Accelerate-AI/AutoEDA/tree/main/notebooks)


## 5. Interpretation Summary

- [X] If we want to get quick insights on statistical inferences, missing values, duplicates, categorical/numerical/text features, correlations, interactions, top and bottom 10 rows, comparision between train and test datasets, then we can leverage some of these AutoEDA libraries and their capabilities.
- [X] This helps in saving time significantly as we quickly generate some statistical inferences, insights as part of these reports / outcomes.
- [X] If the dataset is large, we may use "DataPrep" which seems to be 10X faster than Pandas Profiling as it uses Dask based computing methods.
- [X] We have used one sample dataset (Loan Eligible / Loan Prediction dataset) for the analysis here to demonstrate features of various techniques. These can be used based on scenarios, data context, business need, feasibility etc. These are non-exhaustive list.
