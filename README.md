# AutoEDA (Automated Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Objective

To provide what is AutoEDA, what is the need, why it is used in Data Science projects and what are the libraries / packages that we can leverage from programming language such as Python to help facilitate data exploration and data analysis efforts in any project.

## What is AutoEDA

Any Data Science project/program follows the CRISP-DM methodology. Data Understanding and Data Preparation phases involve EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and this is where we perform data exploration.

Why do we need EDA:
-	Extracting key variables and leaving behind not-so-important variables
-	Identifying various aspects such as outliers, missing values, or any human error in the dataset
-	Understanding the relationship between variables that are present or not present
-	Maximizing our insights of a dataset and minimizing potential error that may occur later in the process by ensuring understanding of data pattern better

How AutoEDA comes into play:
- We leverage some of the existing packages to save time in our analysis efforts
- Lots of messy and large datasets to be analyzed at initial attempt for "Data Understanding"
- Key aspect before we perform any "Data Preparation" / "Feature Engineering" step prior to Model development

## Details

Some of the key AutoEDA in Python are as follows:
- Pandas Profiling
- SweetViz
- AutoViz
- LUX
- D Tale
- Dataprep

**Our attempt here is to capture use cases / real life applications in industry leveraging these
